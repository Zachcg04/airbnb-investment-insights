Date: 10/2025  

## Project Overview
This project explores the 2016 Airbnb Listings dataset to provide actionable insights for property investors and hosts. Using Tableau, the dashboard answers key business questions such as average price per bedroom, revenue by year, and pricing trends across zip codes. The goal is to help clients make data-driven decisions about buying and renting Airbnb properties.

## Key Features
- Interactive visualizations showing average price per bedroom and property type
- Price and revenue analysis by zip code and neighborhood
- Yearly revenue trends for investment evaluation
- Filters for property type, number of bedrooms, and location to allow client-specific insights
- Clean, user-friendly interface optimized for quick decision-making

## Data & Methodology
- **Data Source:** Airbnb 2016 Listings dataset (publicly available)
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and transformed using Excel/Pandas to correct missing values, normalize pricing, and calculate revenue per property
- **Tools:** Tableau Desktop for dashboard creation and visualization
- **Assumptions:** Revenue estimates assume full occupancy for calculation purposes; seasonal fluctuations and occupancy rates are not factored in

## How to Use
1. Open the `Tableau Workbook (.twbx)` file in Tableau Desktop or view it on Tableau Public.
2. Use filters to explore metrics such as:
   - Average price per bedroom
   - Revenue per year
   - Price distribution by zip code
3. Export charts or snapshots for presentations or client reports.

## What I Learned
- How to clean and manipulate a real-world dataset for analysis
- Designing interactive Tableau dashboards for business decision-making
- Translating raw data into investment insights
- Best practices in presenting data to non-technical stakeholders

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate occupancy rates and seasonal trends for more accurate revenue projections
- Add predictive analytics to forecast future Airbnb performance
- Extend analysis to multiple years of Airbnb data for long-term investment planning
